# SAP-ABAP-Project
SAP/ABAP Library Database 
### In this project, I aimed to create a system to organize the usage of the book and member database.

# MEMBER SCREEN
### In this screen there are few options to do. When the screen is opened, we see the current user's ID, Name, Surname and Active/Passive situation. Only active members are displayed.
