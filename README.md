# SAP-ABAP-Project
## SAP/ABAP Library Database 
##### In this project, I aimed to create a system to organize the usage of the book and member database. There are 2 main screens that displays Members and Books. However there are several screens as dialog boxes as well. We will see them in the upcoming sections in this README file.

### MEMBER SCREEN
##### In this screen, we see the current user's ID, Name, Surname and Active/Passive situation. Only active members are displayed.
##### At the top-right of the page there is a dropdown menu named 'Choose an option'. These options are 'Add a member', 'Delete a Member', 'Make Passive', 'Give Book' and 'Return Book'.

### BOOK SCREEN
##### Book screen shows us the books in the database. We see the books' names, authors, and genres.
##### In this screen, we have two options as pushbuttons being 'Add a Book' and Delete a Book'.

### OPTIONS IN ALL THE SCREENS
